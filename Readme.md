Fork of [yu4502's Pytorch version](https://github.com/yu45020/Waifu2x) of [Waifu2x](https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x) with a Google Colab compatible notebook that has some scripts for enlarging (this isn't immediately accessible in the home repo) and doing multi-pass enlargement on entire directories full of images.
